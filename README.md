# CS210-Project-2
Project Summary: 
The Airgead Banking App is a C++ console application designed to help users calculate and visualize the growth of their investments over time. The program allows users to enter financial details such as:
--> Initial investment amount
--> Monthly deposit
--> Annual interest rate
--> Number of years to invest
The application then generates two financial reports: 
Balance and Interest Without Additional Monthly Deposits and 
Balance and Interest With Additional Monthly Deposits.

I structured the program using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. By encapsulating the functionality in a dedicated AirgeadBankingApp class, the program is modular, easy to maintain, and adaptable for future enhancements. I also focused on user-friendly input validation to prevent invalid data entry, ensuring reliability.

Although my code was functional, but some parts of the calculation codes could be optimized to handle larger timeframes or more complex scenarios

One of the most challenging aspects was managing compound interest calculations correctly. I overcame this by breaking down the formula into smaller steps and testing outputs against manual calculations. Using iomanip formatting helped make the reports more readable.

Several skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work such as OOP design (using classes) ,input validation and error handling for user interaction and also financial calculations.

The program is made maintainable and readable through:
-> Clear, descriptive variable and function names.
-> Consistent code formatting and indentation.
-> Modular structure (AirgeadBankingApp class with dedicated methods).
-> In-line comments and structured output for user clarity.
